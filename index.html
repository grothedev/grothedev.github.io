            <h5>August 2025</h5>
            <p>Currently I am living in Virginia. Outside of my job I have some side projects to work on, involving WebSockets, filesystem management (e.g. deduplication, redundancy, synchronization), web development, graphics, GPGPU, and more. I also play drums, sometimes piano, and try to figure out how I should best contribute positively to the future development of humanity (and beyond). </p>
            <p>I will be adding more to this website pretty soon (including resume and other projects). It only exists because I wanted a temporary beacon when my homeserver was unreachable when I was moving.</p>

            <h5>Febuary 2025</h5>
            <p>I told Anthropic's Claude Sonnet LLM to write me a simple program to generate fire effects, because I was working on some animated pixel art and wanted to see what it could do. It ended up making a python script and a javascript webapp. Then I decided to have it make some more things.</p>
